## Front Matter

## Load Data & Add Variables

```{r}

# Find Data & Add Needed Variables
playerstats <- calculate_player_stats(playerstats, weekly = T) %>% mutate(incompletions = attempts - completions, pass_300 = ifelse(passing_yards > 299 & passing_yards < 399.5,1,0), pass_400 = ifelse(passing_yards > 399.5,1,0), rec_100 = ifelse(receiving_yards > 99.5 & receiving_yards < 199.5,1,0), rec_200 = ifelse(receiving_yards > 199.5,1,0), rush_100 = ifelse(rushing_yards > 99.5 & rushing_yards < 199.5,1,0), rush_200 = ifelse(rushing_yards > 199.5,1,0), fumbles = sack_fumbles_lost + rushing_fumbles_lost + receiving_fumbles_lost, rush_10 = trunc(carries/10))

## Create Fantasy Function
